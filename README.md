# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Resources

Software:

- Pandas 1.3.2
- Sklearn 0.24.2
- Plotly 5.3.1
- tensorflow 1.14.0

## Overview

We are being given a CSV data set with 34,000 rows and Using the above libraries, create a binary classifier. I will use Neural Network to predict if a charity will be a successful applicant to donations.

## Steps

- Read tbe Data and drop unnecessary fields
- Determine number of values for important fields and create density plots
- Create and bin Columns with too many variables
- Encode and merge the Dataframe
- Use the Standard scaler to prep the data for use in the Neural Network
- Create the Neural network model using Tensor flow (See below for settings)

- Evaluate the model using created test data
